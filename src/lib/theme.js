/**
 * Light/dark mode toggle (issue #116).
 *
 * The dark palette has existed as CSS custom properties in `../app.css` (the `.dark { ... }`
 * block) since the theming groundwork went in — nothing ever added that class anywhere, so it was
 * dead code. This module is the toggle: it owns applying/removing `.dark` on `<html>`, persisting
 * the choice to `localStorage`, and resolving the default from `prefers-color-scheme` before any
 * explicit choice has been made.
 *
 * Deliberately outside the `AppData` document `$lib/store.js` reads/writes: CLAUDE.md's "all
 * persisted data lives in one JSON blob" rule is about *financial* data that syncs across
 * devices via a Gist. A colour scheme preference is a per-browser display setting, same category
 * as the storage-mode choice `$lib/persistence.js` keeps in `localStorage` directly rather than in
 * the synced document.
 *
 * SSR-safe, same pattern as `./github-auth.js`'s `githubConnection`: nothing here touches
 * `document`/`window`/`localStorage` at import time (the GitHub Pages build prerenders every
 * route). {@link theme} therefore starts at a fixed default on both server and client; call
 * {@link refreshTheme} from `onMount` to read the real value in and apply it.
 *
 * FOUC: by the time `onMount` runs, the page has already painted once. An inline script in
 * `app.html` applies the stored/system theme to `<html>` before Svelte hydrates anything, using
 * the same key and fallback order as {@link resolveTheme} below — duplicated there deliberately,
 * since `app.html` is static markup and can't import this module. Keep the two in sync if this
 * logic changes.
